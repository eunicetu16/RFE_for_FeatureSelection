# RFE_for_FeatureSelection
Recursive Feature Elimination for Feature Selection in Machine Learning

Description: Implement Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important features from a dataset. Use RFE with a machine learning model (e.g., decision tree, logistic regression) and observe how the modelâ€™s performance changes as less important features are removed. Visualize feature importance and plot model performance as a function of the number of features.
Deliverables:

RFE implementation.
Plots showing feature importance and model performance (accuracy, precision, recall) as features are removed.
Discussion on the trade-off between feature reduction and model accuracy.
